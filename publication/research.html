<p align="left">When water is drawn from a homogenous reservoir, all the fluid
layers contribute to the outflow. However, in case of 
a stratified reservoir, the flow at low discharges is confined to a narrow layer 
adjacent to the level of the sink. This phenomenon, known as selective 
withdrawal, has widespread applications in lake and reservoir water quality 
management. Figure 1 compares the streamlines in the homogeneous and stratified
flows. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:0in;line-height:normal">It's known that 
bottom topography and side contractions have appreciable effects on selective 
withdrawal in a stratified reservoir. There is a shortage of knowledge on the
subject in the literature. Recently, we investigated the effects of a bottom sill on 
the establishment of selective withdrawal in a linearly stratified reservoir. The 
problem was first studied analytically (Jamali, 2003) and numerically (Shaaban 
and Jamali, 2003) using a linear theory. It was found that the presence of a 
sill modifies the velocity distribution in the withdrawal layer in the vicinity 
of the sill, which in turn may affect the thickness of the withdrawal layer at 
the steady-state. &nbsp;In a more recent study, the nonlinear problem of evolution of 
the selective withdrawal was studied numerically and 
experimentally (Jamali, Seymour, and Kassaian; 2005), see below.&nbsp;The cases
of a sill in a two-layer fluid and a side contraction in linearly stratified and
two-layer fluids are currently underway. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:0in;line-height:normal">The nonlinear problem of evolution of 
the selective withdrawal was studied numerically and 
experimentally by Jamali, Seymour, and Kassaian; 2005. In the theoretical part,
the fully non-linear, 
viscous equations of motion for a reservoir with an arbitrary bottom sill were 
solved using a finite difference technique in curvilinear coordinates. Fig. 2
shows the results of a simulation of the flow towards a sink for a reservoir with a
bottom sill at the steady-state. For an animation of the model results for
establishment of the selective withdrawal, <a href="topographic_effects_on_selective_files/animation.avi">click

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:0in;line-height:normal">The numerical results were compared to the laboratory measurements of velocity 
distribution in a tank using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique. A good 
agreement was obtained between the theoretical and experimental results. It 
was found that the presence of a sill causes the withdrawal layer to be thicker 
and to shift upward with respect to the flat-bed case. </p>

selective withdrawal of a linearly stratified fluid through a line sink at the 
base of a reservoir with a bottom sill.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Experiments were conducted in a Plexiglas tank 3 m long, 40 cm wide, and 60 
cm high. In a typical experiment, the tank was first filled with a linearly 
stratified fluid using a mixture of fresh and saline water. The two-tank 
technique was used to achieve the desired stratification. The density typically 
varied from ~1010 kg/m<sup>3</sup> at the surface to ~1030 kg/m<sup>3</sup> at 
the bottom.</p>

3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Schematic views of the experimental set-up. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique was used to obtain the flow field 
at a section upstream of the sill. Figure 3 shows experimental set-up. A thin 
sheet of white light illuminated the test section.&nbsp; Pliolite VTAC-L, 
a granular material used in white paint, with good refractive properties and a 
density of approximately 1.028 g cm-3 was used as seeding material. The 
experiments were recorded by a Panasonic mini DV camera with a PAL standard and 
a resolution of 720 by 576 pixels. </p>
<p>To obtain the flow field at a given time, two images with a time separation 
of 0.04 s forming an image pair were extracted from the video clip, see Fig. 4. The pair was 
analyzed by MatPIV, a software developed by Johan Kristian Sveen, University of 
Oslo, Norway. The software is written in Matlab and uses cross-correlation 
algorithm to calculate the velocity field. Interrogation windows of 64 by 64 
pixels were used for the image analysis, and three different filters were used 
to reduce the noise. </p>
